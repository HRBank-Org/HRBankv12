## Previous Test Session: Role-Based Auto-Assignment

### Test Date: December 19, 2025

### Feature: Auto-Assignment

When a worker is assigned to a role, they are automatically assigned to all matching open shifts.

### Test Scenarios:

1. **Role Assignment Triggers Auto-Assignment:**
   - [x] Create role with no workers
   - [x] Create 5 future shifts for that role
   - [x] Assign worker to role via API
   - [x] Verify worker auto-assigned to all 5 shifts
   - [x] Verify `auto_assigned: true` flag on shift assignments

2. **Manual Trigger Auto-Assignment:**
   - [x] POST /{role_id}/auto-assign-shifts endpoint
   - [x] Should assign existing role workers to new shifts

### Test Evidence:
```
POST /api/employer/workplace-roles/role_51b7c6c95b8e/assign
Response: {
    "success": true,
    "message": "Worker assigned to Auto-Assign Test Role successfully",
    "data": {
        "role_id": "role_51b7c6c95b8e",
        "workforce_id": "worker_2337e6a4ce06",
        "shifts_auto_assigned": 5
    }
}
```

### Comprehensive Testing Results (December 19, 2025):

   - API returns proper response structure with worker results and total shifts assigned
   - Currently 1 worker assigned to role, 0 shifts auto-assigned (no new matching shifts)

2. **Role Assignment API:**
   - POST `/api/employer/workplace-roles/role_51b7c6c95b8e/assign` ✅
   - Supports `auto_assign_shifts` parameter (true/false)
   - Returns `shifts_auto_assigned` count in response

3. **Shifts Calendar Integration:**
   - GET `/api/calendar/shifts` ✅
   - Found 5 shifts for role `role_51b7c6c95b8e`
   - Auto-assigned workers properly flagged with `auto_assigned: true`

   - Positions: 1 filled / 3 available

#### ❌ ISSUES IDENTIFIED:

   - Database operation failed due to datetime import scope issue
   - Unable to test role assignment with new workers

2. **Edge Case Testing:**
   - Could not fully test duplicate assignment prevention
   - Could not test auto-assignment disabled scenario

#### 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS:

- **Authentication:** employer@hrbank.ca / Test123! ✅
- **Target Role:** role_51b7c6c95b8e ("Auto-Assign Test Role") ✅
- **Auto-Assignment Logic:** Matches shifts by role_id, workplace_id, and position_title ✅
- **Future Shifts Only:** Only assigns to shifts with start_time >= current time ✅
